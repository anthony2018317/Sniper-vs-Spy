# Sniper-vs-Spy
This game is based off the online game "God Save the Queen". There are around fifty bots moving around in the screen, and one of them is 
the target for the sniper to kill before he gets to all five pots of gold. The bot player uses WASD to move around the screen and reach the 
pots of gold. The sniper is represented by a crosshair, and the sniper's goal is to find out who the bot is, and if the target is killed, 
before the time is up then he wins. Else, the bot wins if he can get to all five pots of gold within two minutes.
